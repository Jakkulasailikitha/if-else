"""

 Take user input in a variable named varx.

Convert it to an integer.
 Check if this number is divisible by 2.

You can achieve this by using the modulus operator. Remember, modulus operator returns the remainder of the division of first operand by the second operand. Example:

 6 % 2 returns 0 as the output because 2 completely divides 6 and the remainder is 0.

But 9 % 2 returns 1 as the output since 2 does not completely divide 9. The remainder is 1.

To conclude, 6 is divisible by 2 but 9 is not divisible by 2.

If the number is divisible by 2, print Divisible else print Not Divisible
